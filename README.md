# Energy-Aware Epidemic Routing
Energy-efficient epidemic routing protocol for ns-3 with battery management and multimedia optimization.

## Overview
This module provides an energy-aware epidemic routing protocol specifically designed for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) with multimedia traffic. The implementation focuses on energy conservation while maintaining reliable packet delivery in intermittently connected networks.

## Key Features
- **Energy-Aware Routing**: Adaptive behavior based on battery levels
- **Multimedia Optimization**: Priority handling for speech and video packets  
- **Battery Management**: Real-time energy monitoring and reporting
- **Smart Flooding Control**: Probabilistic forwarding based on energy levels
- **Adaptive Parameters**: Dynamic beacon intervals and hop count limits

## Usage
See `examples/energy-aware-epidemic-example.cc` for a complete implementation example.
